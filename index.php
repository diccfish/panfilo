				<h1>Narvaez Was Not Finished</h1>
				<p>In fact no one in his party would be finished for a long long time.</p>
				<p>As Narvaez's party moved northward, into present day tallahassee, they ran into the apalachee tribe. After Narvaez insulted the apalachee chief and trying to kill the tribe, he was attacked by the apalachee.</p>
				<p>Narvaez and his party made the decision to build rafts and sail to mexico. Along the way Narvaez died, probably drowned. 8 years later, 4 people, including alvar nunez cabeza de vaca, emerged in Mexico</p>
